## Features

- **Easy to Use**: Integrate components quickly with minimal setup.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be efficient and fast.
- **Customizable**: Tailor components to fit your specific needs.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides to help you get started.

## Installation

To install the **with-react** library, you can use npm or yarn. Run the following command in your project directory:

```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation for each component.

## Components Overview

### 1. Custom Hook Component

This component allows you to create custom hooks easily. It provides a simple interface for managing state and effects.

```javascript
import { useCustomHook } from 'with-react';

function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = useCustomHook(initialValue);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{value}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setValue(newValue)}>Update Value</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Fetch Data Component

This component helps you fetch data from an API and manage loading states.

```javascript
import { FetchData } from 'with-react';

function DataComponent() {
  return (
    <FetchData url="https://api.example.com/data">
      {({ data, loading, error }) => {
        if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
        if (error) return <p>Error fetching data</p>;
        return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
      }}
    </FetchData>
  );
}
```

### 3. Form Handling Component

Easily manage forms with this component, which simplifies state management for form inputs.

```javascript
import { Form } from 'with-react';

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <Form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input name="username" placeholder="Username" />
      <input type="password" name="password" placeholder="Password" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </Form>
  );
}
```

### 4. Themed Component

Use this component to create themed elements that adapt based on the current theme.

```javascript
import { ThemedComponent } from 'with-react';

function ThemedExample() {
  return (
    <ThemedComponent>
      <p>This text changes color based on the theme!</p>
    </ThemedComponent>
  );
}
```
